<h3 align='center'>Welcome to my current personal website!</h3>
<p align='center'>
  It's primary purpose at the moment is to serve as a portfolio website where I present a lil' about me and exhibit my personal projects, but that might change in the future.
  <br />
  This was my first ever serious attempt at making a website. The development process.
