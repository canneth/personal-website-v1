<h3 align='center'>Welcome to my current personal website!</h3>
<p align='center'>This mainly serves as a portfolio website where I present a lil' about me and exhibit my personal projects, but that might change in the future.</p>

<h3 align='center'>This repo is public, but please use it fairly</h3>
I have made this repo public and wish to keep it that way so that others can view the source code, offer constructive feedback, and maybe even learn a little something or two. Like many, I am the beneficiary of countless such open source projects, and I guess this is my little way of giving back.
That being said, please keep in mind that behind any open source project are real people who have invested non-trivial amounts of effort and time to bring these things to you. This project is no different, so it would really suck if the fruits of my labour were to be plagiarised.
However, there is nothing stopping you from forking this repo. If you wish to fork this repo and use this as, perhaps, a starting base for a website of your own, **you may**, but **please provide attribution** by providing a link back to [canneth.dev](https://canneth.dev). Thank you :)
